# Rules

The rules are simple:

Within the range of 1 to 100, you must guess the number chosen by the computer. If you guess correctly, you earn points, and you can choose to continue playing to accumulate points.

If you lose, the game is over, and you can still decide whether you want to play again.

You can choose the difficulty of the game, which will change the number of chances you have and increase your final reward. If you enter letters or an option outside the scope, the program will set the easy mode by default.
